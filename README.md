## Instructions
***My simulation is from the game The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton, separated by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.***
***The rules are the same as in the game Game of Life.***

## What's new?
***I have added new opportunities for Lives***
***This appearance of a new object I called it a "Window into a new world". The lives after passing this window improve and change their colors***

## Sources that I used:

***To do this, I used the code of my teacher Mr. Ruslan Isaev. I added a new class "NewClass" which inherits from the original code and makes additional features***
***Here is a link for Mr.Ruslan's code***
